      Then you, my friend, have come to the right place.
        
      Here at Doughballs, we are obsessed with pizza. And by obsessed, we mean one slice away from an intervention obsessed. Our friends would organize the meeting but theyâ€™re too busy stuffing their facesâ€¦because our pizza is not your typical slice of pie.

      We believe that restricting topping a flakey, buttery, crispy pie crust with just pizza sauce, pepperoni, sausage or cheese should be illegal. Seriously. Why wouldnâ€™t you want to combine the greatest invention known to man â€“ pizza â€“ with other foods that are darn good too, like macaroni & cheese, pot roast, french friesâ€¦ catch our drift?
    </p>

      So thatâ€™s our dream, that this world would welcome pizza with caa-razy toppings with open hearts and growling stomachs. But itâ€™s a two way street, and we know that with great pizza, comes great responsibility.
        
      Thatâ€™s why we focus on three things:
        
      Making ridiculously awesome pizza that actually tastes as good as it looks with the freshest ingredients possible. Duh.
      Keeping the business crowd satisfied during the day & the professional drinkers satisfied by night. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re open 7 days a week, and not just open..open LATE..because the party never stops. And we want to make sure the thousands of suburban bar-goers are served, sobered up & somewhat coherent on a regular basis.
      Making it a priority to give back and have strong ties to the community. Our stores give back to our communities with new donations every month in the form of fundraisers, so youâ€™ll always be eating for a good cause. Begging, bribes & romantic sauce-based poems may increase the size of the donationâ€¦
      So hit us up or mosey on in and check us out. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re all about. If you donâ€™t like it, we donâ€™t care.
        
      We appreciate your business   ðŸ™‚ Call 630-844-5205
